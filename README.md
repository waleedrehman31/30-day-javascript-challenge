# 30-Days JavaScript Challenge

This challenge is from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/)

## Day 1

### 2667. Create Hello World Function

Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World". [Solution](./Day-1/index.js)

## Day 2

### 2620. Counter

Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).
[Solution](./Day-2/index.js)

## Day 3

### 2704. To Be Or Not To Be

Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.

- toBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values === each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error "Not Equal".
- notToBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values !== each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error "Equal".
  [Solution](./Day-3/index.js)

## Day 4

### 2665. Counter II

Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

- increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
- decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
- reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.
